Movies Recommender System
The full dataset: Consists of 26,000,000 ratings and 750,000 tag applications applied to 45,000 movies by 270,000 users. Includes tag genome data with 12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags.
The Small Dataset: Comprises of 100,000 ratings and 1,300 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 700 users.

Simple Recommender:-
The Simple Recommender offers generalized recommnendations to every user based on movie popularity and (sometimes) genre. The basic idea behind this recommender is that movies that are more popular and more critically acclaimed will have a higher probablility of being liked by the average audience.This model does not give personalized recommendations based on the user.

The implementation of this model is extremely trivial.All we have to do is sort out movies based on ratings and popularity and display the top movies of our list. As an added step,we can pass in a genre argument to get the top movies of a particular genre.

I use the TMDB Ratings to come up with our Top Movies Chart. I will use IMDB's weighted rating formula to construct my chart. Mathematically, it is represented as follows:

Weighted Rating (WR) = (v/v+m.R)+(m/v+m.C)

where, . v is the numbeer of votes for the movie . m is the minimum votes required to be listed in the chart . R is the average rating of the movie . C is the mean vote across the whole report

The next step is to determine an appropriate value for m, the minimum votes required to be listed in the chart. We will use 95th percentile as our cutoff. In other words, for a movie to feature in the charts, it must have more votes than at least 95% of the movies in the list.

I will build our overall Top 250 Chart and will define a function to build charts for a particular genre.

Content Based Recommender:-
The recommender we built in the previous section suffers some severe limitations. For one, it gives the same recommendation to everyone, regardless of the user's personal taste. If a person who loves romantic movies (and hates action) were to look at our Top 15 Chart, s/he wouldn't probably like most of the movies. If s/he were to go one step further and look at our charts by genre, s/he wouldn't still be getting the best recommendations.

For instance, consider a person who loves Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, My Name is Khan and Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham. One inference we can obtain is that the person loves the actor Shahrukh Khan and the director Karan Johar. Even if s/he were to access the romance chart, s/he wouldn't find these as the top recommendations.

To personalise our recommendations more, I am going to build an engine that computes similarity between movies based on certain metrics and suggests movies that are most similar to a particular movie that a user liked. Since we will be using movie metadata (or content) to build this engine, this also known as Content Based Filtering.

I will build two Content Based Recommenders based on:

. Movie Overviews and Taglines

. Movie Cast, Crew, Keywords and Genre

Also, as mentioned in the introduction, I will be using a subset of all the movies available to us due to limiting computing power available to me.

Movie Description Based Recommender:-
Let us first try to build a recommender using movie descriptions and taglines. We do not have a quantitative metric to judge our machine's performance so this will have to be done qualitatively.

Cosine Similarity:-
I will be using the Cosine Similarity to calculate a numeric quantity that denotes the similarity between two movies. Mathematically, it is defined as follows:

cosine(x,y) = x.y‚ä∫/||x||.||y||
Since we have used the TF-IDF Vectorizer, calculating the Dot Product will directly give us the Cosine Similarity Score. Therefore, we will use sklearn's linear_kernel instead of cosine_similarities since it is much faster.

We now have a pairwise cosine similarity matrix for all the movies in our dataset. The next step is to write a function that returns the 30 most similar movies based on the cosine similarity score.
We're all set. Let us now try and get the top recommendations for a few movies and see how good the recommendations are.

We see that for The Dark Knight, our system is able to identify it as a Batman film and subsequently recommend other Batman films as its top recommendations. But unfortunately, that is all this system can do at the moment. This is not of much use to most people as it doesn't take into considerations very important features such as cast, crew, director and genre, which determine the rating and the popularity of a movie. Someone who liked The Dark Knight probably likes it more because of Nolan and would hate Batman Forever and every other substandard movie in the Batman Franchise.

Therefore, we are going to use much more suggestive metadata than Overview and Tagline. In the next subsection, we will build a more sophisticated recommender that takes genre, keywords, cast and crew into consideration.

Metadata Based Recommender:-
To build our standard metadata based content recommender, we will need to merge our current dataset with the crew and the keyword datasets. Let us prepare this data as our first step.

We now have our cast, crew, genres and credits, all in one dataframe. Let us wrangle this a little more using the following intuitions:

Crew: From the crew, we will only pick the director as our feature since the others don't contribute that much to the feel of the movie.

Cast: Choosing Cast is a little more tricky. Lesser known actors and minor roles do not really affect people's opinion of a movie. Therefore, we must only select the major characters and their respective actors. Arbitrarily we will choose the top 3 actors that appear in the credits list.

My approach to building the recommender is going to be extremely hacky. What I plan on doing is creating a metadata dump for every movie which consists of genres, director, main actors and keywords. I then use a Count Vectorizer to create our count matrix as we did in the Description Recommender. The remaining steps are similar to what we did earlier: we calculate the cosine similarities and return movies that are most similar.

These are steps I follow in the preparation of my genres and credits data:

Strip Spaces and Convert to Lowercase from all our features. This way, our engine will not confuse between Johnny Depp and Johnny Galecki.
Mention Director 3 times to give it more weight relative to the entire cast.

Collaborative Filtering:-
Our content based engine suffers from some severe limitations. It is only capable of suggesting movies which are close to a certain movie. That is, it is not capable of capturing tastes and providing recommendations across genres.

Also, the engine that we built is not really personal in that it doesn't capture the personal tastes and biases of a user. Anyone querying our engine for recommendations based on a movie will receive the same recommendations for that movie, regardless of who s/he is.

Therefore, in this section, we will use a technique called Collaborative Filtering to make recommendations to Movie Watchers. Collaborative Filtering is based on the idea that users similar to a me can be used to predict how much I will like a particular product or service those users have used/experienced but I have not.

I will not be implementing Collaborative Filtering from scratch. Instead, I will use the Surprise library that used extremely powerful algorithms like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to minimise RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and give great recommendations.

We get a mean Root Mean Sqaure Error of 0.8963 which is more than good enough for our case. Let us now train on our dataset and arrive at predictions.

For movie with ID 302, we get an estimated prediction of 2.686. One startling feature of this recommender system is that it doesn't care what the movie is (or what it contains). It works purely on the basis of an assigned movie ID and tries to predict ratings based on how the other users have predicted the movie.

Conclusion:-
In this notebook, I have built 3 different recommendation engines based on different ideas and algorithms. They are as follows:

Simple Recommender: This system used overall TMDB Vote Count and Vote Averages to build Top Movies Charts, in general and for a specific genre. The IMDB Weighted Rating System was used to calculate ratings on which the sorting was finally performed.

Content Based Recommender: We built two content based engines; one that took movie overview and taglines as input and the other which took metadata such as cast, crew, genre and keywords to come up with predictions. We also deviced a simple filter to give greater preference to movies with more votes and higher ratings.

Collaborative Filtering: We used the powerful Surprise Library to build a collaborative filter based on single value decomposition. The RMSE obtained was less than 1 and the engine gave estimated ratings for a given user and movie.
